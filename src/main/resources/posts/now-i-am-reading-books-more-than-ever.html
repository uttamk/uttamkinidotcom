    books than what I did in the last one year before that&nbsp;. There are a couple of reasons why</p>
<p name="97aa" id="97aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. I bought a kindle paperwhite three months
    ago</p>
<p name="0eba" id="0eba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2. I challenged my philosophy of reading one
    book at a time</p>
<p name="34f2" id="34f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been reading kindle books for the past
    couple of years on my iPad, android phone and my laptop. I got the whole concept of carrying your
    library in your pocket a couple of years ago. I still read on my laptop, if I am learning a new
    programming language. It makes it easy for me to try some code out and then switch back to reading. For
    other stuff like fiction and non fiction I usually used my iPad or my Android phone if I was travelling
    without my iPad. Incidentally I was in the US last year for a short time and thought that the new Kindle
    paperwhite was a good deal and bought it. I am not going to give the usual reason that since there is no
    backlight glare in the paperwhite, I have started reading more books. For me, if I am reading on the
    paperwhite, there are no distractions like checking my email, facebook, twitter, Hacker news or playing
    Subway Surfers. Yes there is a browser, but browsing in black and white is not such a great experience.
    This really helps me get through books faster. The kindle is just an example, any dedicated e-book
    reader (not a tablet) would have done the trick. The great backlight and reading experience on the
    kindle is a bonus.</p>
<p name="db91" id="db91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other accelerator for me was that I
    challenged my superstitious notion of finishing a book and then moving on to the next one. I used to
    round robin between fiction, non fiction and technical books. I realised that at certain times I feel
    like reading and learning something technical, at other times it is reading horror fiction and some
    other times I feel like reading a good non fiction or management book. I just used to block and not read
    as much during my round robin days. Challenging the notion has helped me get through the block and now I
    am more efficient at consuming books.</p>
