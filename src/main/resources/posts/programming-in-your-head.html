<p name="f33b" id="f33b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Programming started out as just a job for me. I started
    enjoying it with time and still do. When I started out, I was like most programmers; Start hacking code and try to
    make it work. I copied pasted code from other files, Stack-overflow and the rest of the internet. I did not
    understand the programming language, the frameworks or the domain much. The focus was on ‘getting something to
    work’. Naturally, I was not a productive developer. It has been eleven years since I started programming
    professionally and I am a much better programmer today. I have to thank the developers whom I worked with and the
    businesses who employed me. I think a huge part of being a good software developer means having skills that have
    nothing to do with typing on the keyboard.</p><h4 name="caab" id="caab" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Happy
    stories and sad&nbsp;stories</h4><p name="7e9b" id="7e9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I have always felt in
    the ‘zone’ when developing some stories. It just felt good every single day when I was doing those stories. The
    software that I delivered was on time, with lesser defects. I can still remember a lot of those stories even after
    so many years. For some other stories, it felt really hard to get anything going. I somehow muddled through them and
    they took much longer than I had planned. The quality of software decreased as my frustration levels increased. I
    felt demotivated every single day I did those stories and I can remember a few of them as well. It felt that like
    life, work also had happy stories and sad ones.</p><h4 name="a020" id="a020" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">
    Taking a step&nbsp;back</h4><p name="e2ba" id="e2ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I realised that the happy
    stories were the ones where I knew the end state and the steps to get to the end state in my head even before I
    started the story. It was just about executing to a script in your head. I could test drive these easily and write
    higher quality software. The sad stories were always the ones where there were a lot unknowns and I dived into
    programming right away. I made assumptions and always had surprises and schedule slippages waiting for me.</p><h4

    developer is to resist the temptation of getting down to code as soon as possible. You first have to understand the
    problem, come to a solution and make sure you de-risk the unknowns before you start implementing the solution. You
    will have to do things that you may not like; For example, talking to people like product folks, customers and
    operations or getting feedback on your design from other developers. You may have to do tech spikes to de-risk
    unknowns before you write production code. You need to make sure that you have a script in your head which you can
    execute. Sure, there will be unforeseen scenarios that you may not have thought about, but it will be way better
    than getting to code and going down an expensive rabbit hole.</p><p name="8bb4" id="8bb4"

    Remember that your job is to solve problems and that happens in your head. Typing code is just a small part of the
    job.</p>
